## ❌ MISSING ITEMS

### 🔴 CRITICAL ITEMS (Must Address)

#### 1. Antimicrobial Treatment
**Cost Impact:** $150 - $350  
**Xactimate Codes:** CLN ANTI, CLN DSNF

**Description:**  
No antimicrobial/disinfectant treatment detected after water exposure. Standard practice for Category 2 or 3 water.

**Justification:**  
Category 2 water (gray water) or Category 3 water (black water) requires antimicrobial treatment per IICRC S500 standards to prevent bacterial growth and health hazards.

---

#### 2. Moisture Testing
**Cost Impact:** $200 - $400  
**Xactimate Codes:** DRY MSTR

**Description:**  
No moisture testing or monitoring documented. Required to verify drying completion per IICRC S500 standards.

**Justification:**  
IICRC S500 requires moisture mapping before and after drying to document moisture levels and verify complete drying. Without testing, there's no verification that structure is dry, leading to potential mold growth.

---

### 🟡 WARNINGS (Should Address)

#### 3. Subfloor Inspection
**Cost Impact:** $800 - $1,500  
**Xactimate Codes:** FLR SUBR

**Description:**  
No subfloor inspection or replacement noted. Water damage typically affects subfloor integrity.

**Justification:**  
Water exposure causes subfloor delamination and warping. Inspection during demolition phase is standard practice. Damaged subfloor must be replaced before new flooring installation.

---

#### 4. Electrical Inspection
**Cost Impact:** $150 - $500  
**Xactimate Codes:** ELC INSP

**Description:**  
No electrical inspection documented. Water exposure may have affected outlets, switches, or wiring in affected areas.

**Justification:**  
National Electrical Code (NEC) requires inspection of electrical systems after water exposure. Outlets and switches in affected areas should be tested or replaced.

---

### 🔵 INFORMATIONAL (Consider)

#### 5. Contents Pack-Out
**Cost Impact:** $1,200 - $2,500  
**Xactimate Codes:** CNT PACK, CNT STOR

**Description:**  
No contents pack-out or storage noted. Typically required during water mitigation and reconstruction.

**Justification:**  
Professional pack-out protects homeowner belongings during demolition and reconstruction. Standard practice for water damage restoration.

---

## ⚠️ QUANTITY ISSUES

### Issue 1: Drywall Removal Quantity
**Line Item:** Remove drywall - wet (280 SF)  
**Issue Type:** Quantity Mismatch  
**Cost Impact:** $518.00

**Description:**  
Drywall removal quantity (280 SF) does not account for both sides of walls. Standard practice is to remove both sides when wet.

**Recommendation:** 560 SF (both sides of affected walls)

---

### Issue 2: Drying Duration
**Line Item:** Drying equipment - 3 days  
**Issue Type:** Quantity Mismatch  
**Cost Impact:** $570.00

**Description:**  
3-day drying period may be insufficient for 450 SF carpet and 280 SF drywall. IICRC S500 typically requires 5-7 days for this scope.

**Recommendation:** 5-7 days (per IICRC S500 standards)

---

## 🏗️ STRUCTURAL GAPS

### Gap 1: Drywall Installation
**Gap Type:** Missing Labor  
**Estimated Cost:** $1,680 - $2,240  
**Xactimate Codes:** DRY 1/2R, DRY HANG

**Description:**  
Drywall removal noted but no drywall installation/replacement included in scope.

---

### Gap 2: Base Trim Reinstallation
**Gap Type:** Replacement Without Removal  
**Estimated Cost:** $340 - $425  
**Xactimate Codes:** CRP BASR

**Description:**  
Base trim removal included but no reinstallation noted.

---

## 💵 PRICING OBSERVATIONS

## 📜 COMPLIANCE NOTES

### IICRC S500 - Moisture Documentation
**Status:** ❌ Not Documented  
**Requirement:** Moisture mapping and documentation

IICRC S500 Standard requires moisture mapping before and after drying. No documentation of moisture readings included.

---

### IICRC S500 - Antimicrobial Treatment
**Status:** ❌ Missing  
**Requirement:** Antimicrobial treatment for Category 2/3 water

If water source is Category 2 or 3, antimicrobial treatment is required per IICRC guidelines.

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS

1. ✅ Request documentation of moisture readings and drying completion
2. ✅ Clarify whether antimicrobial treatment was performed
3. ✅ Verify subfloor condition before flooring installation
4. ✅ Confirm drywall installation is included in scope
5. ✅ Request electrical inspection clearance for affected areas

---

## 📝 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Xactimate estimate covers basic water damage mitigation and restoration for 570 SF of affected space. The estimate includes demolition, drying, and reconstruction of flooring and painting. 

However, several standard items are missing: antimicrobial treatment, moisture testing documentation, subfloor inspection, and drywall installation. Additionally, drying duration appears insufficient per IICRC S500 standards (3 days vs recommended 5-7 days). The drywall removal quantity may need adjustment to account for both sides of affected walls.

**Total estimated gap: $4,800 - $7,900 in missing scope.**
